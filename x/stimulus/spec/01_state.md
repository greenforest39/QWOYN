## Outposts funding pool

This pool is a module account that holds inflationary rewards (QWOYN) and COHO tokens to interact with game players for assets.

COHO tokens will be spent to purchase assets from players. When players purchase items from the outpots, the module account take COHO tokens from players.

Partial tokens spent by players goes to Qwoyn Studios and another portion is burned. This process is managed by game module owner account.

At the beginning of each block, inflated QWOYN tokens on previous block to outposts funding pool is automatically swapped to COHO tokens on game module liquidity pool.
